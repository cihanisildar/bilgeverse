# S3 Migration Complete! üéâ

## What Changed

Your image upload system has been migrated from local file storage to AWS S3. This fixes the production error you were experiencing.

### Files Modified:
- ‚úÖ `app/api/upload/image/route.ts` - Now uploads to S3 instead of local filesystem
- ‚úÖ `app/api/admin/store/route.ts` - Now deletes from S3 when store items are removed
- ‚úÖ `app/api/admin/store/[id]/route.ts` - Now deletes from S3 when store items are updated/deleted
- ‚úÖ `lib/s3.ts` - New S3 utility functions
- ‚úÖ `AWS_SETUP.md` - Complete AWS setup guide

### New Dependencies Added:
- `@aws-sdk/client-s3` - AWS S3 client
- `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` - For generating presigned URLs (if needed later)

## Environment Variables Required

Add these to your production environment:

```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key_here
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name-here
```

## What This Fixes

- ‚ùå **Before**: `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/var/task/public/uploads/store/...'`
- ‚úÖ **After**: Images are uploaded directly to S3 and return public URLs

## URL Format Change

- **Before**: `/uploads/store/1751975391054_o6d7a7.webp`
- **After**: `https://your-bucket-name.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/store/1751975391054_o6d7a7.webp`

## Next Steps

1. **Set up AWS S3 bucket** (follow `AWS_SETUP.md`)
2. **Add environment variables** to your production platform
3. **Test the upload functionality** in development first
4. **Deploy to production**

## Testing

After setup, test by:
1. Going to admin store page
2. Creating a new store item with an image
3. Verifying the image URL is an S3 URL
4. Deleting the item and verifying the image is removed from S3

The migration maintains backward compatibility - existing local uploads will continue to work, but new uploads will go to S3.
